# Life Calendar

Time passes quietly.

Life Calendar is a minimalist project that makes time visible without explaining it.
It does not motivate.
It does not notify.
It does not instruct.

It simply shows what is already happening.

Each dot represents one day.
Filled dots are days lived.
Empty dots are days remaining.

Nothing pauses.
Nothing resets.
Days move forward, one by one.

The project exists to create awareness without pressure.
To be seen in passing, not opened repeatedly.
To sit in the background and let reality do the work.

There are no accounts.
No tracking.
No ads.
No data collection.

The application updates automatically using the device date.
It changes once per day.
Nothing animates.
Nothing asks for attention.

This repository contains the complete system:
a small website that introduces the idea,
and an Android application that sets the wallpaper.

Both are intentionally simple.

This is not a productivity tool.
This is not a habit system.
This is not a reminder.

It is a quiet surface for reflection.

Use it thoughtfully.
